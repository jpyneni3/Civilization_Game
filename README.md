#Civilization Game

I developed this game in the Fall of 2016 for CS 1331. It was our semester project with weekly iterations and this is the final product. It is something I am very proud of because I learned a lot of valuable OOP concepts by doing this project. <br>

To manually compile: <br>
javac -cp src/main/java src/main/java/runner/*.java src/main/java/model/*.java src/main/java/view/*.java src/main/java/controller/*.java

To manually run: <br>
java -cp src/main/java runner.CivilizationGame

Or run the appropriate bash script
