# Civilization_Game


I developed this game throughout first semester at Georgia Tech for CS 1331 in the Fall of 2016. It taught me a lot of valuable OOP concepts and I am proud of this final product. <br>

To compile manually: <br>
javac -cp src/main/java src/main/java/runner/*.java src/main/java/model/*.java src/main/java/view/*.java src/main/java/controller/*.java <br>

To run manuall: <br>
java -cp src/main/java runner.CivilizationGame	<br>

Or use the bat file
